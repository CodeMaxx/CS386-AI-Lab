- The tour generated by MST as compared to berlin52 task 3, gives a better final tour, although taking a couple more iterations.

- No there is no clear winner.

All of them are giving close final minimas in terms of cost.

The major difference is that for random we usually have to do a lot more iterations to get to a minima since it starts from a very large value. On the other hand nearest neighbour and minimum spanning tree are good approximations so the cost of initial task is small.

Between nearest neighbour and minimum spanning, they lead to the minima in comparable number of iterations. Also the final cost is very close; sometimes nearest neighbour gives lower value and sometimes MST.
