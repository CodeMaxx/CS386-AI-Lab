- The tour generated by MST as compared to berlin52 task 3, gives a worse starting tour as compared to nearest neighbour.

- No there is no clear winner between MST and Nearest neighbours. The length of initial path generated are comparable but sometimes MST is better(krob100, pr76) and at other times nearest neighbour(tsp122).

- All of them are giving close final minimas in terms of cost.

- The major difference is that for random we usually have to do a lot more iterations to get to a minima since it starts from a very large value. On the other hand nearest neighbour and minimum spanning tree are good approximations of optimal so the cost of initial task is small.

- Between nearest neighbour and minimum spanning, they lead to the minima in comparable number of iterations. Also the final cost is very close; sometimes nearest neighbour gives lower value and sometimes MST.
